# 🚀 Advanced C Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured path into **C programming** — starting from the basics, moving into **advanced concepts**, and building toward a possible **specialization** (e.g., embedded systems, operating systems, compilers, or high-performance applications).

---

## 📘 Roadmap

### **Stage 1: Foundations**

* Variables, data types, and operators
* Control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`)
* Functions and scope
* Arrays and strings
* Basic pointers
* Structures (`struct`)
* File I/O (basic read/write)

### **Stage 2: Advanced C**

* Deep dive into pointers (function pointers, arrays of pointers)
* Dynamic memory management (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, `free`)
* Data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables
* File handling (binary files, serialization)
* Preprocessor directives and macros
* Bitwise operations and low-level coding

### **Stage 3: System-Level Concepts**

* Modular programming (headers and multiple source files)
* Command-line arguments (`argc`, `argv`)
* Concurrency with POSIX threads (`pthreads`)
* Synchronization (mutex, semaphores)

### **Stage 4: Projects & Specialization**

* Mini projects applying concepts learned
* Explore specialization (embedded systems, OS dev, compilers, HPC, etc.)

## 📝 Assignments

Each topic will include exercises and assignments that reinforce the concepts.
I’ll upload:

* ✅ Example code I follow along with
* 📝 My own solutions to assignments
* 🚩 Reflections on what I learned

---

## 🛠️ Projects (coming soon)

Some ideas as I progress:

* A custom string library
* A simple linked list-based database
* A mini command-line shell
* A small operating-system-like scheduler
* Embedded firmware snippets (if I choose that specialization)

## 📚 Resources

* *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan & Ritchie
* *Expert C Programming* by Peter van der Linden
* TutorialsPoint C Guide
* GNU C Documentation

---

## 🎯 Goal

To master **C programming** from the ground up, gain confidence in system-level thinking, and be ready to specialize in an area where C truly shines.
